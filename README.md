There are many techniques to solve the TSP problem such as , Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA).This repository contain the code and result of my final year research which perform comparison study to evaluate the performance of these two algorithms in terms of execution time and shortest distance. JAVA programing is used to implement the algorithms using same benchmarks and platform conditions.
