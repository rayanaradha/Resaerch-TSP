All data and descriptions come from Heidelberg University site: http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/
This site includes hundreds of tsp maps that can be used as benchmarks. Here I use Symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP). 


Symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP)
==========================================
Given a set of n nodes and distances for each pair of nodes, find a roundtrip of minimal total length visiting each node exactly once. The distance from node i to node j is the same as from node j to node i.
